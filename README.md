1. Improve Gender Balance Across Departments and Regions :
- Address regions or departments where one gender is severely underrepresented.
- Initiate inclusive recruitment drives and targeted training to ensure a balanced talent pipeline.

2. Close the Gender Pay Gap :
- Where salary disparities exist between male and female employees in similar roles or departments, revise the pay structure.
- Implement transparent salary bands tied to role and performance — not negotiation strength or tenure alone.

3. Meet Regulatory Salary Requirements:
- Ensure all manufacturing employees meet or exceed the $90,000 minimum salary requirement.
- Departments or roles that fall below this threshold must be reviewed immediately to avoid regulatory violations.

4. Institutionalize Gender Equity Policies: 
- Introduce an internal Gender Equity Task Force to continuously monitor and report on gender metrics.
- Set measurable DEI (Diversity, Equity & Inclusion) goals and publish an annual Gender Equity Report.

This HR analysis reveals that while the company has a stable workforce, some key issues — particularly around gender distribution, pay equity, and compliance — need to be urgently addressed.

To tackle gender-related disparities, building a workplace culture that is fair, productive, and globally competitive is required. By implementing the above recommendations and continuously monitoring HR data, Palmora can position itself as a progressive leader in the manufacturing industry and create a truly inclusive environment for all employees.
